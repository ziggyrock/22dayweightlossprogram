Studies have shown that 10-40% of the general public is deficient in B12 for example. Certain population groups such as vegan, vegetarians are prone to such deficiency due to their diet. Others that suffer from abdominal ailments or the chronically ill, alcoholics, the elderly, and even people that have undergone gastric surgery are also frequently deficient in vitamin  B12.Vitamins are substances that help the body function and are necessary for  regulatory activities that are essential to life. There are two types of vitamins, water-soluble vitamins such as B  vitamins, and fat-soluble vitamins such as D and E.  Water- soluble vitamins  get excreted if there is excess. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in fat and can accumulate to  toxic levels with over use. That is why fat soluble vitamin are not given in IV therapy infusions.Since vitamins and minerals are essential in the bodies function, deficiency can result in various clinical conditions and, neurological problems. Deficiency can also lead to disruption of several other elements such as mood and sleep that can be easily reversed with replacement . IV magnesium is great for sleep and headaches.  Some mineral supplementation such as Zinc has been demonstrated to decrease the duration and symptoms of common conditions such as upper respiratory infections .<br><br><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/2/embed?mid=1KTnxXvsEkET-GEp4rtV2YK-5c8YpeM1g" width="640" height="480"></iframe><p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">iv bar fort collins</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">iv therapy in fort collins</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">myers cocktail fort collins</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">iv therapy loveland co</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">myers cocktail loveland</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">iv infusion fort collins</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">myers cocktail in normal saline</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">vitamin infusion fort collins</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">iv therapy Fort Collins</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">hangover cure | for prevention or recovery</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">IV to cure hangover</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">IV vitamins- Ft Collins Loveland Greeley</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">IV nutrition and Detoxification</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">iV fluids for hangovers, fatigue & more</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">IV Therapy / Hangover Cure | IV Rehab - Northern Colorado</a><br> <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/appserver-appbucket-1kzwd97zql7te/IV-therapy-Fort-Collins-Colorado.html">Fort Collins Archives - IV Therapy Clinics- IV Hydration Therapy</a><br> </p><br></body><br></html>
